These are a collection of essays and responses––written by yours truly––that should give you some idea of what you should be doing after reading each week. As noted in the [syllabus](syllabus.html/#weekly-assignments), generally your goal is to write a critical essay responding to the readings from that week. Critical does not necessarily mean "disproving." Rather, a critical essay addresses the faults and the merits of the issues in question. Further, evwen when you wish to express extreme disagreement, you should strive to do so in as professional and diplomatic tone as possible. This is doubly important when your respond to your colleagues.
