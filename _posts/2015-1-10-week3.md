This week we continue our study of theoretical approaches to "Classical" music through the lens of musical form--and specifically sonata form. In the last fifteen years, much of the discourse surrounding sonata form has involved two theories that originate in the late 1990s--Wiliam Caplin's theory of formal functions and James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy's concept of dialogic form.

In our readings this week, these two theories are complemented by two others, James Webster's concept of "multivalent analysis" and Janet Schmalfeldt's "form as the process of becoming."
