Concentrating primarily on the  most important strands of rhythmic and metric theory and analysis, this week also focuses on the music of Haydn and Mozart—-with a brief foray into Robert Schumann's instrumental music. These two strands find their source in Lerdahl and Jackendoff's *A Generative Theory of Tonal Music* and William Rothstein's *Phrase Rhythm in Tonal Music.*
