Like so many theoretical ideas, the field of "neo-Riemannian theory" has its origins in David Lewin's transformation theory. (Ironically, perhaps more than in Riemann's own theory.) Richard Cohn is the most important figure here, and his writings on this topic alone could easily form the basis for an entire seminar.
